Overview

This repository provides the data processing scripts and implementation code for the paper:

Event Bias Mitigation: Dual View Debiasing Model for Video Misinformation Detection

The code is released for academic research and reproducibility purposes.

Datasets

We conduct experiments on two public video misinformation datasets:

FakeSV
A large scale Chinese short video misinformation dataset containing video, audio, text, image, and entity information.
Dataset source: https://github.com/ICTMCG/FakeSV

FakeTT
An English TikTok misinformation dataset covering diverse topics and events with multimodal content.
